## ![Stop Forum Spam Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maikuolan/SFS-Mass-IP-Checker/master/public/sfs.gif) __SFS Mass IP Checker__

A stand-alone script for checking IP addresses en-masse against the __[Stop Forum Spam](https://www.stopforumspam.com/)__ database.

### How to install:
To install the SFS Mass IP Checker, all you need to do is upload it to a server somewhere (preferably a server you own and/or control), and then request the "SFS-Mass-IP-Checker.php" file from your browser. It's as simple as that. :-)

### Support/Assistance:
- For support or assistance relating specifically to the SFS Mass IP Checker, please use the [Issues](https://github.com/Maikuolan/SFS-Mass-IP-Checker/issues) page of this repository.
