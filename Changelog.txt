=== Version/Release 0.1.3 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.09.08; Bug-fixes; Maikuolan]: IPs weren't being sorted in the correct
  order; Fixed. Some certain combinations of IPs entered to be looked up using
  the API would sometimes produce offset errors; Fixed. Some certain
  combinations of IPs entered to be looked up using the API would sometimes
  produce a number of entries in the results table without any corresponding
  IPs, giving the appearance of large, empty segments in the results table;
  Fixed. Found a bug whereby some necessary API lookups would not occur if the
  final IP to be checked already had results cached from a previous lookup and
  if the sum total of remaining IPs to be looked up using the API was less than
  15 (obscure but problematic bug; many thanks to dev-101 for posting the issue
  resulting in the investigation and consequent fix for this bug); Fixed.

- [2016.09.10; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved the mechanism for
  checking the validity of IPv4 addresses prior to performing API lookups.
  Added filter for private and reserved IP addresses to prevent unnecessary
  lookups.
